# code-animations

I joined an organization called Steel City Codes May of 2021, looking for a way to help out and volunteer during the summer. I worked as a summer camp instructor, teaching the Java programming language to two 5th grade students who signed up for an introductory Java class.

I noticed that there were some flaws in the way the curriculum was taught: There was a heavy emphasis on text and explanations, but lacked visual representations.

Here's the first animation I made for Steel City Codes, showcasing how a while loop works in Java:

Looking back, I'll admit that it was more rough than I wanted it to be, but that was to be expected for the first few animations. Impressed with the animations, I became an animator for Steel City Codes.

Here are the animations today. I've refined the style and made the movements snappier. Oh, and please ignore the frame rates and low quality. GIF files are not very optimized and quality had to be exchanged to keep the file sizes low.

## This Repository

I've decided to release all the animations to this repository. Please contact me if you want to look at the project files as well, I'd be more than willing to share them. Please contact me if you wish to use my animations for commercial or other non-educational purposes.
