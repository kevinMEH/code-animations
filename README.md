# code-animations

I joined an organization called Steel City Codes May of 2021, looking for a way to help out and volunteer during the summer. I worked as a summer camp instructor, teaching the Java programming language to two 5th grade students who signed up for an introductory Java class.

At the conclusion of the summer camp, I decided that I really liked what I was doing and I wanted to continue working for Steel City Codes. When a form was posted requesting additional curriculum directors, I happily applied. I joined the curriculum team July of 2021.

After joining the curriculum team, I immediately noticed an opportunity to make myself useful. Students are stuck looking at still images and slides, never able to see how lines of code actually execute or how to think inside the brain of the computer itself. I had previously worked with design software such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After Effects. I decided that using my background in graphics design and animation, I could fill a unique role in the team, creating animations which could help students understand programming better.

Here's the first animation I made for Steel City Codes, showcasing how a while loop works in Java:

Looking back, I'll admit that it was more rough than I wanted it to be, but that was to be expected for the first few animations. The executives liked the animations, so I made more.

Here are the animations today. I've refined the style and made the movements snappier. Oh, and please ignore the quality issues. GIF files are not very optimized and quality had to be exchanged to keep the file sizes low.

## This Repository

I've decided to release all the animations along with their project files to this repository. Feel free to look inside the project to see how it's done, and maybe even create your own based off mine. You can attribute to `github.com/kevinMEH`, or just `kevinMEH`.

**NOTE: The animations and project files are for learning purposes only. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, publish or in any other way use my works for any purposes, commercial or personal.**
